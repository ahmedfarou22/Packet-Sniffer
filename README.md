# Packet Sniffer
Welcome to my Python Packet Sniffer! This is a command line tool built using Python from scratch that allows you to capture and analyze network traffic. It uses the raw sockets provided by the python socket module.

This packet sniffer provides the ability to capture packets from the network and display the important information such as source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, packet size and protocols.

The tool is capable of capturing packets in only Linux. It runs in promiscuous mode, which means it captures all the packets that are passing through the network, even those not intended for the host running the tool.

Using this tool, network administrators can troubleshoot network issues, detect malicious activity, and monitor network usage. It is also useful for network security testing and penetration testing.

The tool is easy to use and understand, it's possible to run it by simply specifying the interface to listen on and the number of packets to capture.

Feel free to reach out to me with any feedback or suggestions, as I am always looking for ways to improve the application.
